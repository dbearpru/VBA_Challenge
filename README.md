# VBA_Challenge
Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of the project was to determine the percent change and volume traded for 10 stocks over 2 different years. 

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
The stocks performed much better in the year 2017 vs the year 2018. 
You can see the almost all stocks in 2017 where positive while most 2018 were negative.

Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

The advantage of refactoring code is that you have a base to work off of and can see what is right in the beginning. 
If you do version control you can look back through the code and see what is right and what may need some help. 

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

Similarly to refactoring code it is nice to have a baseline you know is working.
